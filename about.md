  Hi! LRA is a new group initiated in October 2024 within NTNU through the partnership of a set of researchers. 
</p>

Our purpose is to further enable and organize research in legged robotics at NTNU with a focus on systems. We consider the Arctic environment, Space applications and other such high-risk activities to be at the epicenter of our attention. 

Stay tuned!
